# Study Together - Online Group Study Application

## Project Overview

![alt text](image.png)

**Study Together** is an online platform designed to help students collaborate on assignments and study together. This platform allows users to create assignments, submit them, grade their friends' assignments, and manage all tasks in a collaborative environment. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this application provides an intuitive and interactive user experience for students to stay organized and motivated in their studies.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in building a full-stack application using the MERN stack. The app is a learning platform where students can create, submit, and evaluate assignments. It incorporates JWT-based authentication, user roles, Firebase authentication, and a modern, responsive design. 

## Upcoming Features

We are constantly working to improve **Study Together** and plan to add several exciting features in the near future to enhance the user experience and collaboration. Some of the upcoming features include:

- **Real-time Chatting**: A live chat feature that allows users to communicate in real-time while working on assignments or collaborating on study sessions.
  
- **To-Do List**: A personal to-do list where users can manage their tasks, assignments, and deadlines more effectively.

- **Group Chat**: A dedicated group chat feature where users can create groups for different study topics and communicate seamlessly with their friends and classmates.

- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: A feature to upload and share files directly within the platform, allowing users to exchange resources related to their assignments and study materials.

- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for assignment updates, new messages, and upcoming deadlines to keep users informed.

- **Calendar Integration**: Sync assignments and deadlines with a calendar to track due dates and schedule study sessions.

- **Peer Rating System**: Implement a peer evaluation system to allow users to rate and review the assignments of others based on specific criteria.

- **Voice and Video Calls**: Allow users to have voice or video calls directly within the platform for a more interactive group study experience.

We are excited to bring these features to the platform to make **Study Together** a more powerful and user-friendly tool for online learning and collaboration!
